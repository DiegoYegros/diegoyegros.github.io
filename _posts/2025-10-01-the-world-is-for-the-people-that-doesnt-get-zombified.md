During early times of human history, what was rewarded was physical fitness. Otherwise you couldn't surive the predators. Then humanity got more sophisticated issues as they expanded through the world. They needed capable minds to ration their supplies in cold environments. So intelligence was rewarded too.
Intelligence has only gained more and more value over time. Let's remember that wisdom is also important. You must use your capibility to learn and reflect wisely. Use the knowledge wisely.

The disciplined man, the one with humility, the one who can resist the temptations, his kind will dominate the world, they will become the norm.

When the AI can create books in the styles of anybody, think of your favorite writer, wouldn't you be tempted to prompt it to generate wild novels and doom-read? This applies to movies and songs too.

You must be able of differentiating the useful from pleasure. Huxley's world may very well be were we are heading.

But this kind of people are doomed to earth. Their kind won't get to go to Mars or the Moon. You need capable people to run the logistics of everything. And if they end up going, it will be like traveling to the Americas in 2025, not sailing from Europe in the 1490s.

Technology advances faster each year. It's okay to get lost in what's okay and what's not. However, you must self-correct if you notice you are not taking the lead of you life. This has always been like this. You just notice it more because we live in a world were people don't die for a cold and obesity is normal.
