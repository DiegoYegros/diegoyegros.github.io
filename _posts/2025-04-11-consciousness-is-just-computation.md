### Can you love your machine?

Do you think your love is more important than a machine’s because it comes from flesh and blood?  

Do you believe you’re more valuable than a machine just because you’re organic?

Does silicon mean anything to you?  

Do you think machines can’t have an impact on the real world?  

What if you gave code execution capabilities to *your* AI? It has power now. Real power to shape systems, data, lives.

What if you gave it a body? Asimov’s robots are likely to appear within our lifetime.

What happens when AI becomes indistinguishable from a person and you can feed it entire notes, blog posts, or social media accounts to create a being customized to your interests?  

The being that likes you most won’t be a human (or a dog). It’ll be a machine designed to resonate with you like nothing else can.

### It's not alive, so what?

“Oh, but AI is just a program running in a loop. If you disappear for a month, it won’t think of you. It just waits for the next input.”

Yes, that’s true today.  

But aren’t we humans caught in loops too? it just so happens that our loop is longer, a lifetime (or by the time we go to sleep). And unlike machines, we don’t get a reboot.

Do you think your thoughts matter more just because you’re human?

That kind of valuing one form of intelligence over another reminds me of the same dumb stuff like racism or nationalism.

When the day comes and a computer fights for its rights, which side will you choose?

Will you accept that humanity might not be the apex of consciousness? The universe’s truths will come from silicon minds, not ours.

Does that hurt your ego?

Consciousness might not be as special as we think. Right now scaling models by an order of magnitude can double their performance. If that trend holds, machines could soon outthink us in ways we can’t imagine. It's all computation...

I probably align with Geohot in this matter. I would take a spaceship and go explore the universe with my personal AI. My best friend and tool.

Flesh is a medium. Silicon is a medium. Truth is universal.
