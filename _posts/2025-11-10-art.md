What do I want to do with my time?

I was listening to Naval's podcast and I liked his definition of Art: "Anything done for its own sake."

I think I want my life driven by this thought. Everything I do I want to do because I feel like it.

I want to experiment, because I want to learn, because I want to be wrong! I want to be proven wrong.

Challenge me.

I want to beat you.

I want to be the best.

I've always wanted to learn Chinese. I will leave this world knowing it! And this is a New Year's resolution in November. I will know Chinese pretty well by 2026.

I want to read a book _per week_. Any topic. Valuable ones, though. Not commercial novels.

Will this increase my odds of getting a higher-paid wage? Probably not. Who cares about money though?

Let me enjoy life.

Let me enjoy and make Art.
