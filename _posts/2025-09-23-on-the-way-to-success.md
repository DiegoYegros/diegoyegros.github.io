WTF is success anyway?

Is it meant to be lonely?

Should I learn to find contemplating nature sufficient?

Am I even happy?

What do I value most, tech, freedom, companionship, a combination of these?

When am I going to consider I 'succeeded', outside of what people expect?

I enjoy listening to Outer Worlds OST. Makes me feel alive.

Do I succeed when I am able to contemplate the beauty of the world and universe?

What am I really chasing?
